        <p>I was born and raised in Tennessee, where I continue to reside with my husband and son, our cat Erso, and an ever growing pile of unread books. I love coffee, outer space, dark chocolate with red wine, the mountains, and good books. When my nose isnâ€™t shoved into a book or my manuscript, you can find me coding at Nashville Software School. My fictional works are currently written and published under a pseudonym.</p>
